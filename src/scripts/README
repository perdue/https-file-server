Usage Instructions
------------------------
1) Setup ssl.properties
  a) See Setup Instructions Below
2) Execute: sh genKeys.sh


SSL Properties
------------------------
Before you can generate any SSL Scripts, you need to setup the ssl.properties file. It should be in the same directory as the genKeys.sh script. Below is a list of all the properties you can set in the file and a brief description of each.

Name		Req	Description
country		Y	Country to be used for all Certificates/Keys
state=		Y	State to be used for all Certificates/Keys
city=		Y	City to be used for all Certificates/Keys
org=		Y	Organization to be used for all Certificates/Keys
orgUnit		Y	Organization Unit to be used for all Certificates/Keys
server		Y	Server Hostname
clientCount	Y	Number of Client/Server pairs to generate. Set to 0 to generate server certificates only
client_X		Host name for Client X, where X is the Client Number. For example, if clientCount is set to 2, then you will have a client_1 & client_2 property

Configure Client(s)
------------------------
1) Browser is the client: use clients/client_X/client_X.pkcs12
2) Other clients: clients/client_X/client_X-keystore.jks contains the client cert, and
                  clients/client_X/client_X-truststore.jks contains the trusted server cert.
